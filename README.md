# Password Generator
## Description
This is my first JavaScript project.  It is a password simulator where you can choose the number of characters between 8-128. You can also choose the types of characters you want including numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols.  At the end it displays the password with the criteria you selected.
